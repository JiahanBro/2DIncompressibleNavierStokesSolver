# 2DIncompressibleNavierStokesSolver
This repository provides code for numerically solving the 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Two different methods for the spatial discretization namely Finite Differences and the Pseudospectral method are implemented. Runge Kutta 4 is used for the time integration in both methods.
